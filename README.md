# Challenge: Use `.gitignore`

_This challenge checks your knowledge on using a .gitignore file. It will grade automatically, but you can also run the workflow manually to force a challenge to grade._

<!--
  <<< Author notes: Start of the course >>>
  Include start button, a note about actions minutes,
  and tell the learner why they should take the course.
  Each step should be wrapped in <details>/<summary>, with an `id` set.
  The start <details> should have `open` as well.
  Do not use quotes on the <details> tag attributes.

**To start this course: [<img width="150" alt="Use this template" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1221423/148581131-555c0fb8-5361-4450-a760-75fa6219a2fc.png">](https://github.com/githublearn/TBD/generate)**

> We recommend creating a public repository, as private repositories will [use Actions minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions).<br>
> After you make your own repository, wait about 20 seconds and refresh. I will go to the next step.
